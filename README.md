Hi, Iâ€™m Lasse ðŸ¤“ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°

Not a whole lot of interesting stuff here, *yet*. I work with infrastructure architecture and site reliability engineering, primarily around Linux and open source.


A lot of my commits are currently in private repos due to them being customer projects, meaning I don't own the rights to the code and thus cannot publish it in public.

Interests are, but not limited to:
- Kubernetes
- Go
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Configuration management (Ansible)
- Monitoring & observability
- Systems & infrastructure architecture
- Distributed systems
- Platform engineering
